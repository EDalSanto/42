Objective: take file which contains numbers where length of rows and cols
represent axis and ordinate (x and y) respecitively, and the value representing
altitudes (z), and create a graphic plot

Requirements: Makefile, fdf executable, libft, NO Globals, authorfile, miniLibX,
math

Function ideas: get_next_line, ft_split, ft_getnbr

type of projection: parallel, iso, conic
manage expose
quit program with esc
images from minilibX

Bonus: fill boxes with a color according to altitude, manage correctly hidden
surfaces, change types of projections
