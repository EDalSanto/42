# 42
* C projects from 42 USA in Fremont, CA that have enabled me to fundamentally understand how the computer thinks, essential data structures and algorithms, and procedural programming fundamentals. 
* Libft: rewrote a significant part of the [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library).
* Fillit: utilized a recursive backtracking algorithm to optimize the placement of [tetriminos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) on the smallest possible map, oriented to the top left corner.
* Get Next Line: created a function that acts similar to the C standard library function fgets() that obtains the next line from any specified [file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) (i.e., Standard Input). Utilized C static variables and doubly-linked lists to write in under 100 lines of code. 
* Ft_Printf: extensive rewrite of the essential [printf function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string)!
* FDF: graphics projects that explores how to represent 3D images on a computer screen.
* Push Swap: given two [stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) and a very limited number of operations, created a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements in under a specified number of operations.
