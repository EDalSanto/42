* C projects from 42 USA in Fremont, CA that have enabled me to fundamentally understand how the computer thinks, essential data structures and algorithms, and procedural programming fundamentals. 
* Libft: rewrite a significant part of the C standard library
* Fillit: utilize a recursive backtracking algorithm to optimize the placement of tetriminos on the smallest possible map, oriented to the top left corner
* Get Next Line: create a function that acts similar to the C standard library function fgets(), obtain the next line from a specified stream
* Ft_Printf: extensive rewrite of the essentail printf function!
* FDF: graphics projects that explores how to represent 3D images on a computer screen
* Push Swap: given two stacks and limited operations, create a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements in under a specified number of operations
